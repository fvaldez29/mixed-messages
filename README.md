# mixed-messages

This project, very small and simple, is an exercise offered along the @Codecademy **Back-end developer** to practice basic concepts such as arrays, functions and work with the DOM.

In this project I created an application that generates a random text when pressing a button using JavaScript.

## How to install 

Clone the respository.

 `git clone git@github.com:fvaldez29/mixed-messages.git`

Open the file index.html in your favorite browser.
